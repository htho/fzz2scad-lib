# fzz2scad-lib

[fzz2scad](https://github.com/htho/fzz2scad) is a tool to create
[OpenSCAD](https://github.com/openscad/openscad/) Frontplates and
3D-Models from [Fritzing](https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app) Sketches.

This repository lost its purpose as the components moved to specialized
repositories:

  * [fzz2scad](https://github.com/htho/fzz2scad) is the converter.
  * [scadlib](https://github.com/htho/scadlib) is the library manager.
  * [scadlib-electronic-components](https://github.com/htho/scadlib-electronic-components)
  is a library of electronic components.
  These components are (should be) fzz2scad compatible.
